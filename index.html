  <h2>Can't Be Friends</h2> 
   <strong>By: Trey Songz</strong>
   <div class="Lyrics">
  <p>[Verse 1] <br>
Look what this girl done did to me <br>
She done cut me off from her good, good love <br>
She told me that those days were gone (gone, gone, gone)<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus] <br>
Now I'm sittin' here going half crazy (oh, oh, oh)<br>
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too (oh, oh)<br>
And it ain't no way in hell<br>
That I can be just friends with you (you, you, you)<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And I wish we never did it<br>
And I wish we never loved this<br>
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends<br>
Right..<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
The way it felt, no faking it<br>
Maybe we were moving just a little too fast<br>
But what we've done we can't take it back (back, back, back)<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Now I'm sittin' here halfway crazy (oh, oh)<br>
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too (oh, oh)<br>
And it ain't no way in hell<br>
That I can be just friends with you (you, you, you)<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And I wish we never did it<br>
And I wish we never loved this<br>
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends<br>
And all I can say is<br>
La-la-la la la la la<br>
Laahaahaa<br>
La-la-la la la la la la la<br>
La la la la-ooh<br>
La-la-la la la la laah<br>
Hey, ain't no telling what we could've been<br>
Ain't no telling what we could've been<br>
No..<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
And if I knew it ends like this<br>
I never would've kissed you 'cause I fell in love with you<br>
We never would've kicked it<br>
Girl, now everything's different<br>
I've lost my own recoverin' my friend<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
That's why I wish we never did it (hoo, oh yea)<br>
And I wish we never loved this (I wish we never loved this)<br>
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends<br>
Friends, we can't be friends<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
La-la-la la la la la<br>
La-la-la la la la la la la<br>
La-la-la la la la laah<br>
(Ain't no tellin' what we could've been)<br>
